<h2>Difference between var , let , const</h2>
<h3>var:</h3>
<p>The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is defined. If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.</p>
<script>
    var animal = "cat";
    var age = 4;
    var IsMale = true;
    age = "5"
    console.log(animal)
    console.log(age)
    {
    animal = "bunny"
    var color ="black"
    console.log(color)
    console.log(age)
    }
    console.log(animal)
    console.log(age)
    console.log(color)
</script>
<h3>let:</h3>
<p>The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} </p>
<script>
    let  a= 10;
    a++
    if(true){
    let a=20
    console.log(a)
    }
    console.log(a)
</script>
<h3>const:</h3>
<p>The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.
“const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it can be mutated.</p>
<script>
    const pi = 3.14;
    const object ={1:"apple",2:"orange"};
    pi = 3.141
    object[3]= "mango"
    console.log(object)
</script>
