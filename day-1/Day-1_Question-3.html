    <p>JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types</p>
    <P>var x;           - Now x is undefined
       <br> x = 5;           - Now x is a Number<br>
        x = "John";      - Now x is a String<br>
        var x1 = 34.00;     - Written with decimals<br>
        var x2 = 34;        - Written without decimals<br>
        x = 5<br>
        var y = 5;<br>
        var z = 6;<br>
        (x == y)       - Returns true<br>
        (x == z)       - Returns false<br>
    </P>
    <p>strings are written inside "" or ''</p>
    <P>numbers are written as such without quotes.</P>
    <p>booleans are either true or false,Booleans are often used in conditional testing.</p>
    <P>Arrays: JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.Array items are separated by commas.</P>
    <p>var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];</p>
    <p>arrays are indexed from zero , so the first element is zero and last element is n-1</p>
    <p>Undefined: In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.</p>
    <p>example: var car;   </p>
    <p>Null : In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.
        Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.</p>
        <P>typeof undefined           // undefined<br>
            typeof null                // object<br>
            null === undefined         // false<br>
            null == undefined          // true</P>
